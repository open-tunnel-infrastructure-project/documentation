# Monetization

OTIP causes huge amounts of costs due to its vast physical size and therefore
required design and construction work. The maintenance of set up tunnels is also
not for free. There is a monetiztaion framework required that considers
[decentralization](#decentralization), [property rights](#property-rights) and
the [return of investment](#return-of-investment).



### Decentralization

OTIP is about critical parts of our society's infrastructure. The power to
control this must not be in the hands of a few. Even though it might be possible
to let huge enterprises pay the costs of the projects involved, there is an
opportunity and a benefit to design the monetization in a decentralized way in
order to share power and responsibility across masses of individuals and
organizations.



### Property Rights

OTIP is physical infrastructure. Somebody has to use it for something. Somebody
has to pay for it in order to be used. The physical parts can be split up into
pieces and their property rights could be owned by masses of individuals or
organizations. Important here would be that no single party owns too many
property rights, which can simply be enforced by design in the underlying
[protocol](protocol.md).



### Return Of Investment

OTIP aims to be more efficient in solving infrastructure issues than todays
existing solutions. The return of investment can be given by more efficiency of
infrastructure maintenance or even new [business models](business_models.md)
waiting to be discovered and leveraged.
