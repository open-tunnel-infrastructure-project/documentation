OTIP could kickoff new business models helping to increase the return of
investment of the project as such.

* Tunnels can be used in the transportation industry. One vision here could be
  to implement a hyper loop realizing next generation transports of goods and
  people with unseen speeds, in order to get vehicles off our streets.
* Tunnels can be used in the energy industry. Green energy could be harnessed in
  one place and via cables within the tunnels being supplied in a far away other
  place.
