# Problem

Current infrastructures operate mostly overground where a lot of environmental
issues are caused and thus limit usage and development of the supply chain.
Space is limited on the surface. We are forced to operator more or less two
dimensional. Almost always expanding our infrastructures implies some kind of
destruction on the environment. This is bad for a lot of ethical and
environmental reasons. Where ever we operate underground over long distances,
for instance for pipes, we dig holes, setup the pipes, and fill the hole again.
Maintenance is expensive. Once set up, usage cannot be easily changed or
adapted. The future of our societies requires more and more infrastructure able
to transport all kinds of resources over huge distances.



### Resources

* Liquids and gases transported via pipes.
* Customs and people transported via vehicles.
* Information and value transported via cables.
